#### Visitor Goals
- A place to write text of any legths and convert it into peferable voice speech.

## Design
### Colour Scheme
I decided to use red linear gredient colours for background as they are not too bright which helps user to write texts without getting distracted and could help keep the user engaged. Throughout the whole app there are different shades of blue and red.

#### Colours used:
- color1: linear-gradient(45deg, #a82626, #410b05)
- color2: linear-gradient(45deg, #6178b3, #055de0)

## Features
 - This app has ony 1 views of home page.
 - Dropdown select menu button to select the peferable voices.
 - Convert to speech button to convert the texts to speech.
### Landing Page

The landing page is an easy to use page. Minimal information keeping it clear for the user to navigate.
